## Gradient Descent from Scratch

Let's see what happens under the hood when running gradient descent on different models.

### Model examples
* Linear Regression (1)
* Linear Regression (2)
* Logistic Regression

### Programming language
Python

### IDE 
Jupyter notebook (IPython)

### How to use it (the way I do)
1. Install required packages and tools.
2. Fork this repository to have your own copy.
3. Clone this copy on your local system.
4. Make your changes, carry out experiments and draw your own conclusions.

### Important notice
I have focused on making the code simple, readable and easily modifiable.  It is not optimized and omits desirable features.
